Please keep in mind that the Lite Client uses your browser’s local storage to persist your accounts’ data in a secure way. The browser’s local storage is bound to the url of the page, so in this case it will be the path to index.html. This means that if you download the next Lite Client version, please ensure you unpack the archive in the previous version’s directory. Otherwise, the path to the index.html will change and you won’t be able to see your stored accounts.
